# A fullstack web application I made for my sister so that she can add and track her stats game by game as well as feature photos and videos of her playing.

# Features:
1. Utilizes firebase as the backend to hold stats for each game.
2. A page to add stats to the database.
3. A page that allows the user to filter through games based on certain categories.
4. Gives averages over the filtered games. 
5. Page that features photos and videos of her games.
6. Google Authentication is used so that only my family can log games. Anyone with a valid Gmail can view her stats.
